 * When an element is inserted into the list (or updated), it is positioned 
 * such that <tt>node.next</tt> is the next greater value being stored in
 * the list and <tt>node.prev</tt> is the next lesser value being stored in
 * the list. Duplicate values are stored in a single list node, with the node
 * also holding a count of the number of elements with that value.
 * 
 * SortedList "hinted" variants of several methods, where the caller may
 * provide a reference to a value that is close to the search term in the
 * sorted list.  If this is actually the case, the runtime of these methods,
 * which is normally linear <i>in the size of the list</i> will drop to linear
 * in the number of records between the hint and the search term.
